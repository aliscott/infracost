## The resource I want isn't supported

We're regularly adding support for new Terraform AWS resources - be sure to watch the repo for new [releases](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases)! We plan to add support for more cloud vendors ([GCP](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/24), Azure) and other IaC tools (Pulumi) too.

You can help by:
1. [Creating an issue](https://github.com/infracost/infracost/issues/new) and mentioning the resource you need and a little about your use-case; we'll try to prioritize it depending on the community feedback.
2. [Contributing to Infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost#contributing). You can join our [community Slack channel](https://www.infracost.io/community-chat) if you need help contributing.
